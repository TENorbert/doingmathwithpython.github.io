**Updated post after the webcast**

A big thank you to all 200 of you who turned up for the webcast. I really had a great time and hope the session was informative to all of you. Some of you asked a number of questions which I couldn't answer as well as I would have wanted to during the webcast, so I will write those below.


*Question*: What is the difference between an interpret, ide and text editor? And what do you recommend for beginners?

*Question*: What library do we use for importing metric units that works well with sympy?

*Question*: Do you use notebook for exploratory work?

*Question*: Can Sympy be used for the development in a engineering software (i.e. Finite Element Method)? Would the computational speed be (good)? (Not sure about the second part of the question)


*Question*: Thoughts on Cython? Sagemath?

*Question*: Should students use IDLE or a notebook format?

*Question*: Any recommendations for introducing 3D graphics e.g. polyhedrons on screen?

*Question*: How well do SymPy and Numpy work together?

*Question*: You are working in Jupyter - can the "app"s you should be embedded in a regular HTML web page?
