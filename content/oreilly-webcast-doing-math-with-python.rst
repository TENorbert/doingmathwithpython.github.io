**Updated post after the webcast**

A big thank you to all of you who turned up for the webcast across the world. I really had a great time and hope the session was informative to all of you. Some of you asked a number of questions which I couldn't answer as well as I would have wanted to during the webcast, so I will write those below.

**Question**: What is the difference between an interpreter, ide and text editor? And what do you recommend for beginners?

An ``interpreter`` is what runs your program. Without going into the details, the Python interpreter is what converts a statement such as ``print("Hello")`` to a form that can be understood by the computer to finally print ``Hello`` on screen. 
An ``IDE`` or Integrated Development Environment is a software application where we can write programs and run them usually via  Graphical User Interface. IDEs generally feature helpful features such as code completion and can be useful when working with large projects. A ``text editor`` is for writing our programs or other text. It usually doesn't support features that an IDE would support but of course, you can configure and enhance text editors to give you IDE-like features. 

For beginners, I recommend starting with text editors. I think that doesn't overwhelm someone who is learning with the IDE features. That said, `IDLE <https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html>`__ is a good in-between choice for beginners and one that I personally use in the book and definitely would be my first choice.

**Question**: What library do we use for importing metric units that works well with sympy?

**Question**: Do you use notebook for exploratory work?

Yes, I use notebook for exploratory work. I think notebooks are great when you want the code and result together in a single document. It's great for sharing too. I recently created `slides <http://echorand.me/presentation-slides-with-jupyter-notebook.html#.V3XhNe0yphE>`__ as a Notebook.

**Question**: Can Sympy be used for the development in a engineering software (i.e. Finite Element Method)? Would the computational speed be (good)? (Not sure about the second part of the question)


**Question**: Thoughts on Cython? Sagemath?

**Question**: Should students use IDLE or a notebook format?

**Question**: Any recommendations for introducing 3D graphics e.g. polyhedrons on screen?

**Question**: How well do SymPy and Numpy work together?

**Question**: You are working in Jupyter - can the "app"s you should be embedded in a regular HTML web page?




**Announcement post**

I am very excited to share that I am doing a webcast this coming week with O'Reilly titled
"Doing Math with Python". You can register for it on the `event page <http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/3712>`__.

Here are the date and time of the webcast:

- Wed, June 29th at 7 PM, San Francisco
- Wed, June 29th at 10pm, New York
- Thu, Jun 30th at 3am - London
- Thu, Jun 30th at 7:30am - Mumbai
- Thu, Jun 30th at 10am - Beijing
- Thu, Jun 30th at 11am - Tokyo
- Thu, Jun 30th at 12pm - Sydney

I have created a `GitHub repository <https://github.com/doingmathwithpython/oreilly-webcast-2016>`__ which
will have the rough transcript, final slides and the code examples as Jupyter Notebooks.
