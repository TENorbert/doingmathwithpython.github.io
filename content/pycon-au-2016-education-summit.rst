I attended the PyCon Australia 2016 Education seminar held on 12th August at Melbourne, Australia. 
I loved the energy of the seminar and was great to hear about all the ways educators in Australia are
using Python for their teaching. Here are some notes I took, which I also link with the videos. You can 
find all the videos `here <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs4CJRBY5F1Jh6fFqT1p5TZRx5q06CcaR>`__.
