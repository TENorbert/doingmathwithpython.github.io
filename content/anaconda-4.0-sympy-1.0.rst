:summary: sympy 1.0 and Anaconda 4.0

`SymPy 1.0 <http://sympy.org>`__ was released recently and `Anaconda 4.0
<https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer-blog/anaconda-4-release>`__
was just released. I tried all the `sample solutions
<http://doingmathwithpython.github.io/trying-out-solutions.html>`__
and everything works as expected. The `chapter programs
<http://doingmathwithpython.github.io/pages/programs.html>`__ should
keep working as well.

You can get both the updates when you install Anaconda 4.0 or updated
your existing Anaconda installation:

.. code::

   $ conda update conda
   $ conda update anaconda

I have so far verified both on Mac OS X and Linux. If you find any
issues on Windows, please email me at
