If you are using Ubuntu 16.04 and don't want to install the Anaconda
Python distribution for trying out the book's 
`programs <http://doingmathwithpython.github.io/pages/programs.html>` or 
the `sample solutions
<http://doingmathwithpython.github.io/trying-out-solutions.html>`__, this
post is for you.

Ubuntu 16.04 already comes with Python 3 installed, so we only need to install
the following packages:

.. code::

   $ sudo apt-get update
   $ sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib python3-matplotlib-venn python3-sympy idle3


It's worth noting that this will install sympy 0.7.6 and matplotlib 1.5.1 which are
both sufficient for the book's programs.
