:summary: Anaconda 5.0 release

`Anaconda 5.0 <https://www.anaconda.com/blog/developer-blog/announcing-the-release-of-anaconda-distribution-5-0/>`__
was released a few days back. I tried all the `sample solutions
<http://doingmathwithpython.github.io/trying-out-solutions.html>`__
and everything works as expected. The `chapter programs
<http://doingmathwithpython.github.io/pages/programs.html>`__ should
keep working as well.

The versions of the relevant software in this release are:

- Python 3.6
- sympy 1.1.1
- matplotlib 2.1.0

You can update your existing installation using:

.. code::

   $ conda update conda
   $ conda update anaconda=5.0

A fresh installation of Anaconda 5.0 should still be similar to the `instructions <https://doingmathwithpython.github.io/pages/software-installation.html>`__
for earlier versions.
