:summary: Reviews of Doing Math with Python

Readers have shared how they are finding *Doing Math with Python* by
posting reviews on Amazon and their own blog. You can view all of them
on the `Reviews <{filename}pages/reviews.rst>`__ page.

Some readers have also been kind enough to let me know personally how the book
has helped them to restart their programming, or looking at something
they have been putting off. As the author, I think this is the highest
level of appreciation that I could have hoped for.

Recently, Aaron Meurer (the lead developer of SymPy) mentioned the
book in an `episode <http://pythonpodcast.com/aaron-meurer-sympy.html>`__ of
Podcast.__init__ titled "SymPy with Aaron Meurer". If you are curious
to learn more about SymPy, I would recommend listening to it.

I am curious to hear more. If you want to get in touch personally,

Alternatively, if you just plan to write a review, please do so on
Amazon, O'Reilly or your personal blog.
