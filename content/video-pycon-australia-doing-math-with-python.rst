The PDF slides and the demos as Jupyter Notebooks (Python 3) are `here <https://github.com/doingmathwithpython/pycon-au-2016>`__. I have some instructions to download them and try them out. If you face any issues, or have a question, please let me know. 

Thank you to all the PyCon Australia organizers and the Education seminar organizers for a great mini conference
and the opportunity to be a part of it.
