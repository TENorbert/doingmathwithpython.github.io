Hi everyone, I have uploaded the `slides <https://doingmathwithpython.github.io/pycon-us-2016/>`__ for my upcoming talk at the PyCon Education Summit. If you are coming to the talk, feel free to have a look at the slides and have any questions/comments ready for me.

The slides are made using Jupyter Notebook + nbconvert magic. Thank you to everyone who makes these things happen. You can see the slides notebook `here <https://github.com/doingmathwithpython/pycon-us-2016>`__.
