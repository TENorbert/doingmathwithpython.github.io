Chapter 5
=========

On page 132, in the section "Probability," the code line above the one
marked with a (3), which reads ``for num in s:`` should instead read:
``for num in space``.

On page 139, in the code for simulating a fictional ATM, the statement
``probability = [1/6, 1/6, 1/3, 2/3]`` should be ``probability = [1/6,
1/6, 1/3, 1/3]``.  (Thanks to Luis Soares)
