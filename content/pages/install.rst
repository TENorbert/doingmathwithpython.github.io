The programs in the book and the proposed solutions are tested to run
on ``Python 3.5``, ``matplotlib 1.4.2``, ``matplotlib-venn 0.11`` and ``sympy
0.7.6``. The version numbers stated are the minimum requirements and the
programs should also work with higher versions of the
software. However, if there is any change, it will be noted
accordingly here.

There are various ways of installing these required software but one
of the easiest is to use the `Anaconda
<http://continuum.io/downloads>`__ Python 3 software distribution
available freely for Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

- `Windows <{filename}install/windows.rst>`__
- `Linux <{filename}install/linux.rst>`__
- `Mac OS X Yosemite <{filename}install/macosx.rst>`__

Updating your existing installation
===================================

Once you have installed Anaconda, over time you can keep it updated to the latest version using the following commands from your terminal::

    $  conda update conda
    $  conda update anaconda
