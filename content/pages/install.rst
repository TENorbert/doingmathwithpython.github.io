The programs in the book and the proposed solutions are tested to run
on ``Python 3.3``, ``matplotlib 1.4.2``, ``matplotlib-venn 0.11`` and ``sympy
0.7.6``. The version numbers stated are the minimum requirements and the
programs should also work with higher versions of the
software. However, if there is any change, it will be noted
accordingly here.

There are various ways of installing these required software but one
of the easiest is to use the `Anaconda
<http://continuum.io/downloads>`__ Python 3 software distribution
available freely for Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.  At the
time of this writing, the latest release of Anaconda is ``2.1.0`` with
``Python 3.4``.

The next two sections will briefly describe the installation on the
first two operating systems assuming internet connectivity is
available.

- `Windows <{filename}install/windows.rst>`__
- `Linux <{filename}install/linux.rst>`__

The Anaconda software distribution is also available for Mac OS X and
can be installed similar to as on Windows and Linux. Please see the
instructions on the downloads page at http://continuum.io/downloads#34
for Mac OS X for help on installation.
