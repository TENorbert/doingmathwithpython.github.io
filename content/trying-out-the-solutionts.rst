:summary: Trying out the solutions

Once you `download
<https://www.nostarch.com/download/doingmath_code.zip>`__ the solutions ZIP file, and extract it you will
find the solutions for each chapter in the corresponding 
sub-directory. Before you can try them out, you will have to open
them first in IDLE.

Let's consider the solution to a challenge posed in Chapter 6 to draw
the Mandelbrot set. Start ``IDLE`` and click on the menu item ``File >
Open`` and navigate to the location where you extracted the directory
above and open the file ``mandelbrot.py``.

To run the program, click on ``Run > Run Module`` and you should see
the Mandelbrot set in the matplotlib window.
