:summary: Trying out the solutions

Once you `download
<https://www.nostarch.com/download/doingmath_code.zip>`__ the solutions ZIP file, and extract it you will
find the solutions for each chapter in the corresponding sub-directory.

The **PDF** file contains explanations for each of the solutions
similar to the explanations for the programs in the book.

Before you can try the programs out, you will have to open them first in IDLE.
Let's consider the solution to a challenge posed in Chapter 6 to draw
the Mandelbrot set - ``mandelbrot.py``. Start ``IDLE`` and click on the menu item ``File >
Open`` and navigate to the location where you extracted the directory
above and open the file ``mandelbrot.py``.

Running the program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the program, click on ``Run > Run Module`` and you should see
the Mandelbrot set in the matplotlib window.

All the solutions should be ready to run, try them out, make changes
to experiment and let me know what you come up with!
